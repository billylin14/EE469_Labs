Here are the git commands that will be useful:

Standard Procedures for doing the labs: (just in case I forgot how to do it)
:
                              (start and end at master)
git checkout -b (branch name) //go to you own branch
                              (do usual coding)
git status                    //check what's modified
git add/rm                    //add or remove what's modified
git commit -m "message"       //commit the change to the branch
git push -u (branch name)     //push the commit to the branch
git checkout master           //return to master branch
git merge (branch name)       //merge the updated branch to master

Git commands
:

Creating a repo
1. create a new repo on github website
2. copy the https and type "git clone https://..." in git bash
3. "cd" to change the working directory to the folder cloned
(adding to an existing repo: 2~3)

Modifying the repo
1. git add/git rm              //add/remove files in the repo
2. git commit -m "message"     //commit the change
3. git push -u (branch name)   //push the commit to remote

Branching
git branch                     //check the current branches
git branch (branch name)       //create a new branch
git branch -d (branch name)    //delete an existing branch
git checkout -b (branch name)  //create a branch and jump into it
git checkout (branch name)     //go into a specified branch
git merge (branch name)        //merge the new changes
